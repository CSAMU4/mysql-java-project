**WEEK 11:** Final Project: Finish adding the UPDATE and DELETE CRUD operations to the assignment, and will create a working full CRUD program.

Objectives: 
1) Modify project details using the UPDATE statement. 
2) Delete a project and all child rows using the DELETE statement. 
3) Observe that using ON DELETE CASCADE automatically deletes child rows with a FOREIGN KEY relationship.    
4) Use the return value from: 
        PreparedStatement.executeUpdate() to determine if a row was updated or deleted.

**WEEK 10:** Expand on the menu app to list all the projects(name and ID). Then, write code to select a project to the edit. 
 
 Objectives: 
 1) Fetch a List of Projects record using SQL query skills.
 2) Learn how to perform multiple queries in a single transaction. 
 3) Write an inner join to fetch category rows related to a project row. 
 4) Use an Optional to either return a project record to throw a custom Exception. 
 5) Practice Lambda expression to list the projects and to throw a custom Exception from an Optional.
