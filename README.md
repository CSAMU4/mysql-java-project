# mysql-java-project

This was a MySQL project at Promineo Tech. This project assignment was to develop a menu-driven application that demonstrates how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Read) operations on a DIY project database.

WEEK 11: 

    WEEK 10: Expand on the menu app to list all the projects(name and ID). 
    Then, write code to select a project to the edit. 
  
    Objectives: 
    1) Fetch a List of Projects record using SQL query skills.
    2) Learn how to perform multiple queries in a single transaction. 
    3) Write an inner join to fetch category rows related to a project row. 
    4) Use an Optional to either return a project record to throw a custom Exception. 
    5) Practice Lambda expression to list the projects and to throw a custom Exception from an Optional.
